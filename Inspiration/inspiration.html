            <h3>VRATISLAV PECKA</h3>
        </a>
        <img src="img/vratislav.jpg" alt="vratislav pecka artwork" width="800px">
        <h4>Vratislav Pecka's work mainly consists of poster designs. He inspires me because 
            <br>even though a lot of his work uses simple shapes, they are used effectively. The 
            <br>colors that he uses feel cohesive and his designs make great use of space. There's 
            <br>a lot going on in his designs, but they don't feel overwhelming.

            <h3>RAFAEL SERRA</h3>
        </a>
        <img src="img/rafael.png" alt="rafael serra artwork" width="800px">
        <h4>Rafael Serra does a lot of typographic work. I like his experimentation with type. 
            <br>He takes existing logos and redesigns them in a different style. In a lot of 
            <br>his work, he plays around with the letterforms. There's different orientations, 
            <br>differing heights, etc.

            <h3>SAUL BASS</h3>
        </a>
        <img src="img/saul.jpg" alt="saul bass artwork" width="700px">
        <h4>Saul Bass inspires me because he uses limited color palettes effectively. A lot of 
            <br>his designs consist of 2 - 3 colors. His designs feel geometric, but also have 
            <br>this handmade feel because the shapes look as if they've been cut out and pasted 
            <br>on. He also takes complex shapes and simplifies them down enough to still be 
            <br>able to distinguish what it is.
